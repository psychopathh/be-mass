                  <p>A well-known fact is that in order to gain muscle mass, burn excess fat and build a beautiful shape, you must actively engage in power training. <br>However, with BeMass you can do much less, and the muscles will grow 7 times faster *</p>
                  <p>BeMass increases the level of nitric oxide in the blood 3 to 4 times, thereby increasing the effectiveness of strength training. Nitric oxide is responsible for the expansion of capillaries and the increase of blood flow to the muscle fibres, and it is an important component of protein. With its high nitric oxide content  muscle grows in 2 to 3 weeks of training.</p>

                      <p>“I am a professional bodybuilder. I take part in different competitions every year. To me, BeMass is the best bodybuilding supplement and I have tried a lot. BeMass gives the most noticeable effect. If you focus on it and do it from scratch, within a short while muscle mass and definition will begin to appear. Then the gain tapers off but the muscle mass remain the same. If you are looking for a healthy and beautiful body, BeMass is the answer. It’s my sincere advice.”</p>
